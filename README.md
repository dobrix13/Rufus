### scenario 1.0: Rufus (The Beggar's Quest)

Introduction: Long, long, and longer time ago in a far, far, very far land, there lived a beggar named Rufus. He resided just outside the kingdom, in the woods, in a very poor wooden cabin. Despite his ragged clothes and humble life, Rufus had a heart full of dreams.

One day, as he wandered near the castle, he saw the beautiful Princess Isabella and fell head over heels in love. His heart pounded, and his vision blurred. Rufus knew, without a doubt, that he would do anything to win her heart. Even if it meant giving his soul to the devil.

 ### scenario 1.1: The Beginnings of a Quest Determined to pursue his love, Rufus faces three choices:

1. Visit the taverne in the town: 1.2 Perhaps the rowdy crowd and a hearty ale will provide some useful advice or a way to get closer to the princess.

2. Visit the witch in search of some magic: 1.3 A sprinkle of magic might just be what Rufus needs to stand a chance. Surely the local witch would have some potion or spell to aid his cause.

3. Go to the devil himself: 1.4 Desperate times call for desperate measures. Will Rufus risk everything to make a deal with the devil?

The journey begins. What will Rufus choose?

### Scenario 1.2: The Taverne

Rufus stepped into the taverne, expecting a lively and welcoming place. To his shock, he found himself in a dark and sinister den, and immediately, a chill runs down his spine. The place is dark and eerily quiet, with shadows dancing across the walls from the flickering candlelight. The air is thick with the stench of stale ale and something else—perhaps despair. In the far corner, hidden in the darkest shadow, sits a lone, drunken customer, muttering incoherently to himself.

The barkeeper, a burly man with a perpetual scowl, stands behind the counter wiping down an already spotless mug. His eyes are as cold and unfriendly as the rest of the establishment.

Rufus knows he must proceed carefully in this unsettling place. He has three options:

1.  Speak with the Barkeeper: 1.2.1 Perhaps the grumpy barkeeper has some useful information or knows a way to get closer to the princess.

2.  Speak with the Drunk Stranger: 1.2.2 The lonely customer in the corner might have a tale or a clue to help Rufus in his quest.

3.  Leave the Taverne: 1.2.3 This place feels dangerous and unwelcoming. Maybe it's best to seek help elsewhere.

What will Rufus choose next?

### Scenario 1.2.1: The Barkeeper

Rufus, mustering all his courage, approached the barkeeper. The man behind the counter was as rude and ugly as his appearance suggested, and the smell emanating from him was enough to make anyone's eyes water.

"What do you want, beggar?" the barkeeper growled, his voice as unfriendly as his demeanor.

"Please, sir," Rufus began hesitantly, "I'm looking for any information that could help me get closer to Princess Isabella."

The barkeeper's eyes narrowed. "Information costs money, and you look like you don't have two coins to rub together."

Rufus's heart sank. He had hoped for some kindness, but it was clear that this man wouldn't help him without payment. With no money in his pockets, Rufus was forced to consider his next move.

He had three choices:

1. Speak with the Drunk Stranger: 1.2.2 The lonely customer in the corner might have a tale or a clue to help Rufus in his quest.

2. Leave the Taverne: 1.2.3 This place feels dangerous and unwelcoming. Maybe it's best to seek help elsewhere.

3. Go and Search for Money: 1.2.4 Rufus needs to find some money to buy a drink and get the information he needs.

What will Rufus choose next?

### Scenario 1.2.2: The Drunk Stranger

Rufus, feeling both curiosity and caution, approached the lone figure in the darkest corner of the taverne. The stranger's head was hidden beneath a dark hood, and his face was obscured by shadows. As Rufus drew closer, he could hear the man muttering to himself, his words slurred and soaked in melancholy.

"...Love... light... everyone... love is light... everyone is light... everyone is love..."

Mustering his courage, Rufus spoke softly, "Hallo."

The stranger's head lifted slightly, revealing a glint of eyes beneath the hood. He turned towards Rufus, his voice gravelly and tinged with sorrow, "Who goes there? What do you want?"

Rufus hesitated, but then decided to be honest, "I am Rufus. I'm in love with Princess Isabella and I'm seeking help to win her heart."

The stranger let out a bitter laugh, "Love, you say? A fool's errand, but maybe... just maybe... I can help you. My ale is empty. If you get me another drink, I’ll tell you a secret."

Rufus had to decide how to respond. He had three options:

1. Go and Search for Money: 1.2.4 Rufus needs to find some money to buy a drink and get the information he needs.

2. Punch the Stranger in the Face: 1.2.5 Feeling frustrated and desperate, Rufus could resort to violence, though this might have consequences.

3. Leave the Taverne: 1.2.3 If Rufus felt uneasy about the situation, he could choose to thank the stranger and leave, searching for help elsewhere.

What will Rufus choose next?

### Scenario 1.2.4: The Dwarfs in the Mines

Rufus realizes he needs money to get the help he needs. His journey to find money leads him deep into the forest, where he stumbles upon a hidden mine occupied by dwarfs. The dwarfs, skilled miners and craftsmen, promise to make Rufus rich if he agrees to stay and work for them.

The dwarfs explain their terms to Rufus, offering him a chance to become wealthy beyond his wildest dreams. But there’s a catch: they won't let him leave without fulfilling his work obligations. Rufus now faces a difficult decision and has three choices:

1. Stay and Work for 10 Years: 1.2.4.1 Rufus could choose to stay and work hard for ten years, earning one piece of gold.

2. Stay and Work for 15 Years: 1.2.4.2 Rufus could decide to work even longer, staying for fifteen years, to earn two pieces of gold.

3. Kill the Dwarfs and Steal the Gold: 1.2.4.3 Tempted by immediate riches, Rufus considers betraying the dwarfs and taking their gold by force.

What will Rufus choose next?

### Scenario 1.2.5: The Drunk Stranger (Continued)

If Rufus chooses to punch the stranger in the face: Rufus, driven by frustration and desperation, lashes out and punches the stranger. To his horror, the stranger swiftly stands, revealing a sharp dagger hidden beneath his cloak. "You shouldn't have done that," the stranger hisses, and before Rufus can react, the assassin strikes. The room grows dark, and Rufus's quest ends then and there. GAME OVER

### Scenario 1.2.3: (leaving taverne)

If Rufus chooses to leave the taverne: Rufus decides that this dark and eerie place is not where he'll find his answers. He leaves the taverne, stepping back into the cold night air. He now has three choices:

1. Search for Money: 1.2.4 Rufus must find some money to buy a drink and get the information he needs.

2. Visit the Witch: 1.3.0 Perhaps some magic could aid Rufus in his quest.

3. Visit the Devil: 1.4.0 Desperate times call for desperate measures, and Rufus considers making a deal with the devil.

### Scenario 1.2.6: Returning to Town as a rich man

After enduring many years in the mines and surviving the harsh conditions, Rufus finally returns to town as a rich man. However, wealth alone does not make him any more handsome, and he still faces the same challenges in winning Princess Isabella's heart.

Despite his newfound riches, Rufus knows he must find another way to achieve his goal. He now has three choices:

1. Go back to the Taverne and Buy the Drink for the Stranger: 1.2.4.4 Perhaps now, with money in his pockets, Rufus can buy the stranger a drink and discover the secret he promised.

2. Visit the Witch: 1.3 Maybe some magic could finally help Rufus in his quest to win the princess's heart.

3. Visit the Devil: 1.4 Desperate and willing to risk everything, Rufus considers making a deal with the devil to achieve his dreams.

What will Rufus choose next?

### Scenario 1.2.4.4: Returning to the Taverne

Rufus, now a wealthy man after working tirelessly in the mines, returns to the taverne. The moment he steps through the door, the atmosphere feels different. The barkeeper, who was once cold and unfriendly, suddenly becomes very welcoming and eager to please.

"Welcome back, sir!" the barkeeper says with a wide, fake smile. "How can I help such a distinguished gentleman like yourself today?"

Despite the change in the barkeeper's demeanor, the drunk stranger still sits alone in the darkest corner, muttering to himself about love and light.

Rufus, now with money in his pockets, faces three choices:

1. Buy a Drink: 1.2.6.2 With his new wealth, Rufus can buy a drink and finally get the information he needs from the barkeeper or the drunk stranger.

2. Speak to the Stranger: 1.2.6.1 The mysterious figure in the corner might still hold the key to Rufus's quest.

3. Exit the Taverne: 1.2.6 If Rufus feels this place has nothing more to offer, he can leave and seek help elsewhere.

What will Rufus choose next?

### Scenario 1.2.6.1: Returning to Stranger

Rufus tries to speak to the stranger without buying a drink, the drunk stranger's demeanor turns deadly. Annoyed by the disturbance, the stranger suddenly springs to life, revealing a hidden dagger. With a swift and lethal strike, the stranger kills Rufus for disturbing him.

GAME OVER Rufus, You are never going to get her! Ha ha ha....

### Scenario 1.2.6.2: Give drink to the Stranger

"So, you're looking for some secret to earn a woman's heart, right?" the stranger asks, his voice dripping with sarcasm.

Rufus, feeling a bit uneasy, replies, "Yes, that's right."

The stranger's laughter grows louder, echoing through the taverne. "The secret is this," he says, leaning in closer. "Ha! That's quite a story," the barkeeper chuckles. "Listen, here's what you do: take some blunt object, sneak up on the princess, hit her from the back, and drag her home while she's stunned. Ha ha ha!"

Rufus's heart sinks. He realizes that the stranger's advice is just as cruel and unhelpful as the barkeeper's. Feeling disheartened and worried, Rufus must decide his next move.

Rufus has three choices:

1. Punch the Stranger in the Face: 1.2.5 (Game Over!)

2. Go to the Witch: 1.3

3. Go to the Devil: 1.4

What will Rufus choose next?
