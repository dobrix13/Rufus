## Title: Rufus (The Beggar's Quest) ##

Introduction: Long, long, and longer time ago in a far, far, very far land, there lived a beggar named Rufus. He resided just outside the kingdom, in the woods, in a very poor wooden cabin. Despite his ragged clothes and humble life, Rufus had a heart full of dreams.

One day, as he wandered near the castle, he saw the beautiful Princess Isabella and fell head over heels in love. His heart pounded, and his vision blurred. Rufus knew, without a doubt, that he would do anything to win her heart. Even if it meant giving his soul to the devil.

*scene 1:* The Beginnings of a Quest Determined to pursue his love, Rufus faces three choices:

  1. Visit the taverne in the town: Perhaps the rowdy crowd and a hearty ale will provide some useful advice or a way to get closer to the princess.

  2. Visit the witch in search of some magic: A sprinkle of magic might just be what Rufus needs to stand a chance. Surely the local witch would have some potion or spell to aid his cause.

  3. Go to the devil himself: Desperate times call for desperate measures. Will Rufus risk everything to make a deal with the devil?

The journey begins. What will Rufus choose?
